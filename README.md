# Fully Connected Neural Network (FCC) Java Implementation 
I wrote this when I was in grade 11 as a personal project. The purpose of this project was to introduce myself to machine learning. This primitive deep learning implementation supports vanilla backrpopogation to train a fully connected neural network. 

I tested this on the MNIST database where the model converged and learned to classify hand-written images.
